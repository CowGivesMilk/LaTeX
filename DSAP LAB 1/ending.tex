\subsection*{Discussion}
During this lab, we implemented MATLAB scripts to generate various fundamental signals. We observed that the continuous signals were plotted using smooth curves, while discrete signals were plotted using discrete data points, providing a clear representation of sampled data. 
\subsection*{Conclusion}
Hence, we successfully generated various basic signals using MATLAB. Through this, we visualized the behavior of fundamental signals that are essential in the analysis and design of communication systems, control systems, and signal processing applications.
